      <p class="defaulttext">The Trill were a humanoid species native to the planet Trill. Some members of the species co-exist in a symbiotic relationship with a sentient organism known as a symbiont.</p>
      <p class="defaulttext">Trill were distinguished by a pattern of spots from the top of their head to their toes. These patterns differ from individual to individual however.</p>
      <p class="defaulttext">Those Trill that became joined to a Symbiont had personalities which were a synthesis of the two beings including the memories, and to some extent the personalities, of the previous hosts of the symbiont.</p>
      <p class="defaulttext">One of the most important parts of the joining process is the Zhin'tara ritual, where an unjoined Trill makes a connection between the current host and a friend or relative, temporarily placing the personality and memories of a previous host into the other. This is a way for hosts to gain closure, and is required by the Symbiosis Commission.</p>

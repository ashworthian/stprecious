      <p class="defaulttext">The Betazoids were a telepathic humanoid civilization originating from the Federation planet Betazed.</p>
      <p class="defaulttext">Externally, Betazoids were physically indistinguishable from Humans in every aspect but one: the irises of their eyes were completely black.</p>
      <p class="defaulttext">In mid-life, Betazoid females underwent a physiological change known as "The Phase" during which their sex drive increased by a factor of four or more.</p>
      <p class="defaulttext">Mature Betazoids could also suffer from Zanthi fever, which caused them to lose control over the projective aspect of their empathy. This could result in people around them acting as if they had experienced the same general emotional state as the affected Betazoid, though they were directed by their own subconscious desires, fears, and other emotions.</p>

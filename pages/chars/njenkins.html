            <p class="biohere">In <a href="../../pages/time/2366.html">2366</a>, Nathan was born to <a href="../../pages/info/ranks/admiral.html">Admiral</a> <a href="../../pages/chars/jgred.html">J'gred</a> and <a href="../../pages/info/ranks/commander.html">Commander</a> <a href="../../pages/chars/tjenkins.html">Tynisha</a> as their first child. And from a very early age was intrigued by the mysteries of Space and the ideology of exploring it due to the stories his mother Tynisha would tell him about it when he was growing up. One such story involved how his parents first met.</p>
            <p class="biohere">In <a href="../../pages/time/2368.html">2368</a>, Nathan became a brother at the age of two when his mother gave birth to his first sister <a href="../../pages/chars/rjenkins.html">Ria</a>. Tynisha explained to him when he was slightly older and could understand her words around the time his second sister <a href="../../pages/chars/nejenkins">Neomi</a> was born in <a href="../../pages/time/2369.html">2369</a> at the age of three that he was Ria and Neomi's big brother and needed to protect them from anything that might harm them.</p>
            <p class="biohere">Something he felt compelled to do since his father was extremely busy and was rarely able to visit them. This is the main reason that during the siblings later years both at home and at <a href="../../pages/info/places/starfleetacademy.html">Starfleet Academy</a>, the three relied on each other. So much that they would not allow any harm to come to one another.</p>
            <p class="biohere">When Nathan turned eighteen in <a href="../../pages/time/2384.html">2384</a>, he decided to finally follow in his parents footsteps and enroll to Starfleet Academy. It was only a few years prior to this that he also explained to Ria that she was Neomi's big sister and would need to take care of her since he would not be able to do so whilst being away from their home. Something which would become null and void when his two sisters joined Starfleet Academy as well.</p>

            <p class="biohere">Nathan and by extension his family has owned many pets over the years, though only four in particular were specifically his. Three of these notable pets were <a href="../../pages/info/misc/cats.html">cats</a> named Tiger, Chester and Belle. The fourth notable pet which is his current pet is a <a href="../../pages/info/misc/husky">Husky</a> named <a href="../../pages/chars/maverick">Maverick</a>. Maverick was given to Nathan by a friend of his mother's whose purebreed Huskies had given birth to a litter. Ever since Nathan has had Maverick, his father has been quite irritated since felines do not cope well with canines. But because of Nathan only being partially feline, canines have never bothered him.</p>

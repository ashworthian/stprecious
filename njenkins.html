            <h4 class="bioheadsub">pre-adult years</h4>
            <p class="biohere">In 2366, Nathan was born to Admiral J'gred and Tynisha Jenkins as their first child. And from a very early age was intrigued by the mysteries of Space and the ideology of exploring it due to the stories his mother
              Tynisha would tell him about it when he was growing up. One such story involved how his parents first met.</p>
            <p class="biohere">In 2368, Nathan became a brother at the age of two when his mother gave birth to his first sister Ria Jenkins. Tynisha explained to him when he was slightly older and could understand her words around the time his
              second sister Neomi Jenkins was born in 2369 at the age of three that he was Ria and Neomi's big brother and needed to protect them from anything that might harm them. Something he felt compelled to do since his father was extremely
              busy and was rarely able to visit them.</p>
            <p class="biohere">This is the main reason that during the siblings later years both at home and at Starfleet Academy, the three relied on each other. So much that they would not allow any harm to come to one another. When Nathan turned
              sixteen in 2382, he decided to finally follow in his parents footsteps and enroll to Starfleet Academy. It was only a few years prior to this that he also explained to Ria that she was Neomi's big sister and would need to take care of
              her since he would not be able to do so whilst being away from their home. Something which would become null and void when his two sisters joined Starfleet Academy as well.</p>

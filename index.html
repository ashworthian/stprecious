      <p class="hometext">Star Trek: Precious is a series set in the year 2409, approximately 30 years after the events of the film Star Trek: Nemesis. Following the crew of the U.S.S. Pureshashu where the Federation has entered a time of both
        relative peace but is also on the verge of war with the Klingdom Empire. The latter of which can no longer allow the Federation to maintain peace with the Romulan Empire due to their great distaste for the Romulans. But the Klingons are not
        the only nefarious individuals who seek to cause chaos and conflict throughout the known galaxy.</p>
      <p class="hometext">Both familiar enemies and new foes will test the Federation’s founding principles of peace and exploration in a time where Starfleet must hold onto these principles more than ever. The Starship Pureshashu, NCC-86521, a newer
        generation Vesta-class vessel was recently commissioned by Admiral J’Greed for his newly promoted son, Nathan Jenkins. Upon it’s departure for it’s maiden voyage which was to entail the pick-up of it’s exexcutive officer as part of a friendly
        agreement between the United Federation of Planets and the newly formed Romulan Republic, as well as end the voyage by returning to Deep Space Nine for it’s final crew members.</p>
      <p class="hometext">However this particular event in history begun a series of events that would lead the Pureshashu and it’s crew from one bad situation into another. During which time, the Klingdom Empire would begin to become more and more
        aggressive as the Federation and the Klingdom Empire would then soon enter all out war. Therefore for what would start out as a set of missions of a peaceful nature including the re-exploration of the Delta Quadrant would ultimately lead the
        Pureshashu and it’s crew into a deadly plot deeloping behind the scenes that may very well change the galaxy as everyone knows it, forever.</p>
